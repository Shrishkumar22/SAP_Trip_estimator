# SAP_Trip_estimator

Trip estimates are beneficial to approve, reject, or modify a trip. This also helps in budgeting for the trip. The current process allows users to enter the requested amount for a trip, but there is no way to compare it to a trip estimate. Adding a trip estimator feature can help in notifying the approvers about the trip estimated amount and their quested amount difference, which can prompt them to ask the user to reassess the amount requested based on the trip estimator.

Therefore - An app for an overall average trip estimation during their quest creation for the user/ during their approval for the approver.
